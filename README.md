# VillegeHub

VillageHub is a web application built to modernize and digitize the daily operations of Grama Niladharis (village councilors). It replaces traditional paper-based workflows with a secure and efficient digital platform, reducing manual errors and improving data accessibility. Core features include household data management, appointment booking, subsidy requests, certificate issuance, election and field visit tracking, and more. VillageHub enhances accuracy, speeds up administrative tasks, and supports better service delivery to local communities.
